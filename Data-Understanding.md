# c. Data Understanding

In previous section we understand what is the problem and what kind of data and result we are looking for. In this section we should check that is the data relevant to the problem? Is it vakud and reflect our expectations and is the data quality, quantity, and recency sufficient to continue the project? 
One fundamental technique in this phase is data visualization. In particular, a few things to look out for are outliers, highly skewed distributions, correlations amoung variables, and explicable values and errors and missing values but there are just some examples and depends on type of problems and data we maybe should use other methods.  


## Outline

###   [I) Data Quality] (#Quality)
###  II) Data Visualization
### III) Correlations
###  IV) Outliers
###   V) Missing Values
###  VI) Dimension Reduction and Principal Component Analysis

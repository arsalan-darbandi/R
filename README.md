# How to Become a Data Scientist?
In this page I want to explain basic but important materials for who wants to be a Data Scientist. All materials in this page is from experiences from several projects, I gained and from courses that I took. I hope that at least some codes and information give you some help.

## 1. Introduction
<a name="structures"/>
### a. A Road Map for Reader and Structures

First, Section 2 describes the most important part which is data mining. Lots of information about data and different purposes and types of data processing can be find in this section. Then, Section 3 is about Machine Learning which is mixed and related to data mining and some of the materials in this section are similar to previous section. Section 4 and 5 are about two important languages which are used for data processing and commands and helps are brought over these two sections. 

References: I will add this part later.
